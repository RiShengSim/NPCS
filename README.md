# NP Courier Service

Welcome to the project repository for the NP Courier Service! This project was created as a requirement to the Web Application Development module in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. This project was created with C# and Razor in the ASP.NET Core MVC framework.

## About the project

We were tasked to create a web application for both staff and customers of a fictional NP Courier Service. Internally, a Microsoft SQL Server database is used to keep track of parcels and their delivery progress as they are shipped from sender to receiver. We are responsible for using ASP.NET Core MVC to create a web app that both stakeholders can use.

## Getting started

To get started, we recommend using the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) IDE for proper IntelliSense, NuGet, and LibMan support.
